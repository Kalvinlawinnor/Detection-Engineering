How to leverage the sources and requirement chracteristics to produce requirement?
=> An important aspect of detection engineering to discuss and include from the beginning of the lifecycle
is the processes that should be created along with the tools to be leveraged in order to efficiently

For tools:
=> We are looking at productivity tools that can assist in implementing
the processes developed by the DE team, rather than technical solutions used for developing detections.
