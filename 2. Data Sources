#2 different types of data sources and telemetry

  1. Raw Telementry:
                - Unprocessed data of event that occurred without any determination on whether it is malicious or not.
                - We can use these raw logs to identify malicious behaviors/activity without relying on other pre-built detection rules from EDR, security tools.

  2. Security Tooling:
                - Focuses on processed events.
                - Can also include its own raw telementry data.

#Endpoints and servers
    - Endpoints and servers generate logs detailing activities occurring on the host. 
      This includes important events such as user logins and administrative activities (such as configuration changes or user creations).

    - Every operating system has its methods of logging, so we have to consider what OS our endpoints and servers are running. 

Type of logging:
    - Windows: 
              - Application Log: Events generated at the application level. Logs may vary as they depend on developer configurations.
                        Ex: The application crashed due to memory exhaustion

              - System log: Events generated at the operating system level related to system operations.
                        Ex: A service was started

              - Security log: Events generated at the operating system level related to potential security risks.
                        Ex: User account creation

              - PowerShell log: Any events related to the PowerShell engine (the program), providers, and commands
                        Ex: PowerShell application started

              - Sysmon Log: Any events generated by the Sysmon service.
                        Ex: Process Creation

Note (Windows): 
        => Note that PowerShell event logs only include full command lines if PowerShell Script Block Logging is enabled. 
        It is disabled by default and must be enabled via a Group Policy Object or the Registry. 
        Without these command lines, we lack the most important context surrounding PowerShell execution. 
        Knowing an attacker executed PowerShell provides little value if we donâ€™t know what they used it to do.

        => Note that Sysmon is not installed on Windows by default but provides highly valuable data. 
        Sysmon logs include those for process creation (including hashes and command-line details), network connections, and filesystem changes, 
        all of which are either not logged or logged with a minimal context in the default Windows Event Logs.




  - Linux:
          - /var/log/syslog:     All global system activity data 
          OR / var/log/messages
                        Ex: Startup messages.

         - /var/log/auth.log:   All security-related events 
          OR / var/log/secure
                        Ex: Account logins, root account actions.


        - /var/log/cron: Information about scheduled tasks
                        Ex: Command execution resulting from a cron job
